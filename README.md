Description:-
   * src/: This directory holds the main application code.
   * components/: This subdirectory contains reusable UI components:
     * LoginForm.jsx: Component for user login.
     * UserList.jsx: Component to display a list of users.
     * UserCard.jsx: Component to display details of a single user.
     * UserForm.jsx: Component for creating or editing user information.
   * pages/: This subdirectory contains components representing different pages of the application:
     * LoginPage.jsx: The login page.
     * UsersPage.jsx: The page displaying the user list.
     * EditUserPage.jsx: The page for editing user information.
   * utils/: This subdirectory contains utility functions:
     * api.js: Handles API calls (likely using Axios as mentioned).
   * App.jsx: The main application component that sets up routing and renders the main layout.
   * index.js: The entry point of the application, renders the App component into the DOM.
   * routes.js: Handles application routing (likely using React Router).
 * package.json: This file defines project dependencies and scripts. It will be created when you run npm init -y in the project directory.
 * public/: This directory holds static assets.
   * index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the template for the application.
To create this repo:
 * Create a new directory for your project.
 * Navigate into the directory in your terminal.
 * Run npm init -y to create a package.json file.
 * Create the src and public directories.
 * Create the subdirectories and files as shown in the structure above. You can leave the files empty for now.
 * Copy the content of your README into README.md.
To run the application (after adding code):
 * Install dependencies: npm install.
 * Start the development server: npm start.
 * Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
This setup provides the basic structure based on the information in your README. You'll need to fill in the actual code for each component and configure routing and API calls based on your specific application requirements.
